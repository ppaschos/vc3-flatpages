With the first release of VC3 and the Fall "capability demonstrator" on the horizon, the VC3 team had a face-to-face developer meeting in Chicago from July 17 to July 19 2017. The main goals where to finalize the software architecture of the VC3 static infrastructure, commission the VC3 static infrastructure on our OpenStack private cloud, integrate the website into static infrastructure, manually create a virtual cluster (VC), and sketch out a road map forward to the first release. 

For the VC3 static infrastructure, we were able to finalize and implement the software architecture, and commission the VC3 static infrastructure including a VC3 master, VC3 inforservice, VC3 factory, and static HTCondor central manager using the our OpenStack private cloud. We were able to use the static infrastructure to submit jobs to MWT2 resources and the UChicago campus cluster. This provides us the foundation for create a VC. 

We were able to nearly complete the connection between the VC3 website and the static infrastructure. As for the manual creation of a VC, we had all the individual components running. We ran out of time to be able to have information flow from one end of the VC3 chain (website or CLI interface) to submitting pilot jobs.

Overall, we considered this meeting a success. We were able to accomplish nearly all the goals we had set out and were able to see jobs going to sites we will be using for our Fall "capability demonstrator".
