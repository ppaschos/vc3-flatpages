title: May 23, 2018 Closed Beta Release
date: 2018-06-23
tags: [meetings]

The VC3 project is searching for users and HPC resources to evaluate its closed-beta release. During the closed-beta release there might be system bugs, 
instabilities and lack of availability. 
The VC3 user closed beta invitation signup is [here](http://bit.ly/vc3-signup). 
If you would like to add an HPC resource to the VC3 platform for testing, please complete this [form](http://bit.ly/vc3-new-resource). 
You do not necessarily need to have an institutional affiliation with the HPC resource organization, but should have an allocation to run jobs there.
