## AutoPyFactory: A Scalable Flexible Pilot Factory Implementation

- Event Type: Technical Paper
- Published: Journal of Physics Conference Series 396(3)

### Description
> The ATLAS experiment at the CERN LHC is one of the largest users of grid computing infrastructure, which is a central 
> part of the experiment's computing operations. Considerable efforts have been made to use grid technology in the most 
> efficient and effective way, including the use of a pilot job based workload management framework. In this model the 
> experiment submits ‘pilot’ jobs to sites without payload. When these jobs begin to run they contact a central service 
> to pick-up a real payload to execute. The first generation of pilot factories were usually specific to a single Virtual 
> Organization (VO), and were bound to the particular architecture of that VO's distributed processing. A second 
> generation provides factories which are more flexible, not tied to any particular VO, and provide new and improved 
> features such as monitoring, logging, profiling, etc. In this paper we describe this key part of the ATLAS pilot 
> architecture, a second generation pilot factory, AutoPyFactory. AutoPyFactory has a modular design and is highly 
> configurable. It is able to send different types of pilots to sites and exploit different submission mechanisms and 
> queue characteristics. It is tightly integrated with the PanDA job submission framework, coupling pilot flow to the 
> amount of work the site has to run. It gathers information from many sources in order to correctly configure itself 
> for a site and its decision logic can easily be updated. Integrated into AutoPyFactory is a flexible system for 
> delivering both generic and specific job wrappers which can perform many useful actions before starting to run 
> end-user scientific applications, e.g., validation of the middleware, node profiling and diagnostics, and monitoring. 
> AutoPyFactory also has a robust monitoring system that has been invaluable in establishing a reliable pilot factory 
> service for ATLAS.
